        <h1>Welcome to My Coding Journey</h1>
        <p>Today I'm learning HTML and building my first webpage!</p>
        
        <h2>Why I'm Learning to Code</h2>
        <p>I want to create websites, apps, and maybe even games someday.</p>
        
        <h3>What I've Learned So Far</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the structure of web pages.</p>
        
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>1. Build a personal website</p>
        <p>2. Create a blog</p>
        <p>3. Make a simple game</p>
        
        <h4>Small But Important Note:</h4>
        <p>Every expert was once a beginner. This is my start!</p>
