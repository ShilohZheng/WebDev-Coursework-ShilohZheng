# **Reflection on Unit 1 - The Web and Web Development**

**In Unit 1**, I learned about the history of the web, how web browsers and websites work, and the basics of HTML. The lessons covered important topics like the structure of HTML, formatting text, and creating a simple webpage. It was interesting to see how the web has evolved and how developers use tools to build websites.  

**One challenge I faced** was remembering all the HTML tags and their uses, and also the different functions like bolding, emphasizing, and deleting the words. I was fascinated by all the stuff that HTML can do, but I struggled a bit at the beginning. It was confusing to know which tag to use for headings, paragraphs, or lists. And to remember the different format of using different formatting tages. To overcome this, I practiced by writing small pieces of code and checking my work with the browser. 

**This unit connects** to the overall web development process because HTML is the foundation of every website. Learning these fundamentals has given me a solid starting point for building my own web projects in the future.
