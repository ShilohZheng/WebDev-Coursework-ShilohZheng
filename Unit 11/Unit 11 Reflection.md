# Unit 11: Web Design Journey - From Basics to Future Paths  

This course took me from creating basic HTML pages to building interactive, accessible websites. I discovered how HTML structures content, CSS brings designs to life, and JavaScript adds functionality. The UN Global Goals showed me how tech can solve real-world problems, while accessibility lessons taught me to design for everyone.  

JavaScript logic confused me at first (why didn’t my buttons work?). Mobile layouts broke unexpectedly on small screens. Color contrast checks felt tedious but became eye-opening. I practiced debugging with console.log(), used Chrome DevTools to test responsive designs, and ran my sites through accessibility checkers until they passed. Prototyping and peer feedback were game-changers!  

This unit tied everything together: Technical skills (coding) + design thinking (planning) = better websites. Iteration is key – my first draft was never the final version. Accessibility isn’t optional – it’s how we include all users.

I’m excited to explore: UI/UX design (Figma prototypes!) JavaScript frameworks like React, Freelance projects for local businesses. Final advice to myself, celebrate small wins – that ‘broken’ navbar today will be your proudest fix tomorrow!!
