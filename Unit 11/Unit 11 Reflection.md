# Unit 11: Web Design Journey - From Basics to Future Paths  

## What I Learned  
This course took me from creating basic HTML pages to building interactive, accessible websites. I discovered how **HTML structures content**, **CSS brings designs to life**, and **JavaScript adds functionality**. The UN Global Goals showed me how tech can solve real-world problems, while accessibility lessons taught me to design for everyone.  

## Challenges I Faced  
- **JavaScript logic** confused me at first (why didn’t my buttons work?).  
- **Mobile layouts** broke unexpectedly on small screens.  
- **Color contrast** checks felt tedious but became eye-opening.  

## How I Overcame Them  
I practiced debugging with console.log(), used Chrome DevTools to test responsive designs, and ran my sites through accessibility checkers until they passed. Prototyping and peer feedback were game-changers!  

## Connecting to Web Development  
This unit tied everything together:  
1. **Technical skills** (coding) + **design thinking** (planning) = better websites  
2. **Iteration** is key – my first draft was never the final version  
3. **Accessibility isn’t optional** – it’s how we include all users  

## Looking Ahead  
I’m excited to explore:  
- **UI/UX design** (Figma prototypes!)  
- **JavaScript frameworks** like React  
- **Freelance projects** for local businesses  

**Advice to My Past Self**:  
"Celebrate small wins – that ‘broken’ navbar today will be your proudest fix tomorrow!"
