# **Unit 2 Reflection: Design and Design Thinking**

In Unit 2, I learned about the importance of design in web development and the key principles of design thinking. The lessons explained how design is everywhere, especially in websites, and introduced the structured process of design thinking. I now understand that good design isn't just about looks, it's about solving problems in a user-friendly way. I'll keep that in mind when creating my own web.

One challenge was grasping the steps of the design thinking process, like empathizing with users and prototyping solutions. At first, it felt abstract, but breaking it down into smaller parts helped. I practiced by analyzing well-designed websites and brainstorming improvements, which made the concepts clearer.

This unit connects to web development because design is the first step in creating a functional and appealing website. Without thoughtful design, even the best code can result in a confusing or unattractive site. Learning design thinking has taught me to plan with the user in mind, which will be crucial as I move forward in building my own projects.
