# Unit 3 Reflection: Client Project

In Unit 3, I learned how to work with clients to design a website that meets their needs. Through interviewing sample clients like Sara, Kai, and Shannon, I discovered how important it is to understand someone's personality and goals before starting to code. I now see that a good website isn't just about technical skills - it's about listening and problem-solving.

One challenge was figuring out how to turn a client's ideas into an actual website plan. At first, it was hard to decide what features to include. I overcame this by making lists of the client's most important points and sketching simple layouts before writing any code.

This unit connects to web development because it taught me that every great website starts with understanding the people who will use it. Just like in Unit 2's design thinking, I learned to start with research before jumping into building. These planning steps will help me create better websites in the future.
