# Unit 9 Reflection: Introduction to JavaScript

In this unit, I discovered how JavaScript brings websites to life by making them interactive. I learned that JavaScript is a programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic content, like responding to button clicks or updating text without reloading the page. Key topics included using `onClick` event attributes, functions, and modifying HTML elements with JavaScript. For example, I now understand how a button press can trigger a function to change a webpage’s content.
 
The most confusing part was linking JavaScript to HTML and figuring out how events like `onClick` work. I also struggled with writing functions correctly—sometimes my code didn’t run because of small syntax errors, like missing brackets or typos.

I practiced by redoing the code examples from lessons and using the browser’s console to debug errors. Watching tutorial videos and asking my teacher for help clarified how events and functions connect to HTML. Breaking problems into smaller steps (e.g., testing one line of code at a time) made debugging easier.

This unit showed me how JavaScript is the "action" part of web development, while HTML structures content and CSS styles it. Together, they create engaging websites. Understanding JavaScript is essential for building modern, user-friendly web applications—like forms, games, or animated menus.
