# Unit 7 Reflection: Solve a Problem, Serve a Purpose  

This unit connected web development to real-world problem-solving through referencing The **UN Global Goals** framework for creating purpose-driven websites. I've learnt the design thinking principles like using the following ways: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test; to structure projects. I now have an idea of how to build a community website that addresses local needs like event organization.  

I've faced some challenges, such as aligning technical skills with social impact. I struggled to translate broad goals into specific web features. I also face problems simplifying complex ideas for a clear user experience.  

I solve these problems by breaking down goals into actionable components, like creating an "Events" section for community engagement. I also used card-based layouts to present information digestibly, whhich is what I learned in Unit 6.  

I found some connections with the real world shown significantly in this unit, it reinforced that good design solves problems first, with aesthetics second. It also mirrors "claim-evidence-reasoning" – every design choice needed justification. I argue that this unit shows that code isn’t just about functionality; it’s a tool for change.
