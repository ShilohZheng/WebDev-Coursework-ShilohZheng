# Unit 6 Reflection: Feedback and Iteration  

This unit emphasized the importance of **client feedback** in web development. I learned how to structure questions to gather meaningful input, like first impressions, readability, design feel. I also learnt to use HTML/CSS to polish a page, by applying favicons, image borders, `<span>` tags. I've acknowledged that I should always iterate based on feedback while keeping designs simple and functional.  

I found that balancing client preferences with design best practices, like various color choices and ensuring readability is always something I should take priority on when creating my website.  I also need to translating vague feedback into actionable changes, which require a lot of work.  

I've tried to create specific questions to guide clients and prototyped small changes like adjusting border radii to demonstrate options visually. I found that the feedback loops indicate real-world workflows, where collaboration shapes the final product. Moreover, writing clear questions and summarizing feedback reinforced the concise communication skills we learn in Composition class, similar to crafting thesis statements or peer reviews.
