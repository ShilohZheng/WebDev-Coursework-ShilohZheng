# Unit 10 Reflection: Feedback and Iteration  

In this unit, I learned how to create a multi-page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, design a navigation bar that works on both computers and phones, how to properly size and position images using CSS, and how to link different files together using relative paths. The most valuable lesson was about **responsive design** – making websites look good on any screen size. I now understand why media queries are so important in modern web development.

Some issues that I faced include the navigation bar issues, my menu didn't work properly on small screens at first. I also encoutered image problems, my photos looked stretched or didn't fit their containers. Moreover, I faced file organization problem, specifically, I found keeping track of all the folders and files was confusing.

To solve my concerns, for the navigation bar, I studied how popular websites like Wikipedia handle mobile menus and adjusted my media queries. I fixed image issues by using `object-fit: cover` and setting specific widths/heights, and I created a clear folder system (images/, css/, js/) to stay organized.

This unit showed me that building websites is an **iterative process** – you create, test, fix, and improve. The design principles I learned (like consistency and hierarchy) are the same ones professionals use. Understanding these fundamentals helps me see how all the pieces of web development fit together, from planning to coding to testing.
