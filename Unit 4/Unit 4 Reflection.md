## My Thoughts on Unit 4 - Styling with HTML  

In this unit, I learned how to make websites better using HTML. I now know how to add titles and language tags to webpages. I practiced making different kinds of lists - numbered lists, bullet points, and even lists inside lists. The part about adding pictures was cool too - I learned the difference between linking to online images and using pictures from my computer. The most important lesson was about making websites accessible for everyone, like adding descriptions for images so blind people can understand them.  

At first, I had trouble with pictures - sometimes they wouldn't show up or were the wrong size. I kept practicing and finally understood how file paths work. The accessibility rules were confusing at first because there were so many things to remember. I took it step by step and used the examples from class to help me. Doing the code challenges really made things clearer for me.  

Everything I learned in this unit is important for making real websites. Good lists help organize information, pictures make sites more interesting, and accessibility means everyone can use my websites. These skills are the building blocks for everything else I'll learn about web development.
